# My Secret Service 🚀

A **real-time, anonymous chat application** built with **React, Redux, WebSockets, and Node.js**. This project allows two users to chat **privately** without requiring any login or authentication. The messages are transmitted securely over WebSockets, ensuring instant communication.

## 🔥 Features
- **Anonymous & Secure** – No sign-ups, no data collection, just chat!
- **Real-Time Messaging** – Powered by WebSockets for instant updates.
- **Private Sessions** – Only those with the shared link can join the chat.
- **Minimal & Fast UI** – Built with React for a smooth user experience.
- **State Management** – Redux ensures efficient data handling.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React, Redux, React DOM
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, WebSockets
- **State Management:** Redux
- **Real-Time Communication:** WebSockets (Socket.io / Native WebSockets)

## 🚀 How It Works
1. The app is **hosted online**, and the user shares the chat link with a friend.
2. Once both users join, they can send and receive messages **in real-time**.
3. No third party can join the chat, ensuring **privacy**.
